# Content Requirements Document: mudlistings.com Website Redesign

## 1. Introduction/Overview

**Project:** Redesign of mudlistings.com - a directory website for Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) games.

**Purpose:** Transform the website from an outdated listing site into a modern, welcoming directory that celebrates MUD culture and history while making it easy for players to discover games and administrators to promote their MUDs.

**Content Objective:** Create website copy, UI text, and supporting content that balances nostalgic warmth with modern usability, positioning MUDs as a vibrant, living gaming community rather than a relic of the past.

## 2. Goals

1. **Increase game discovery** - Help players (new and returning) find MUDs that match their interests through clear, scannable content
2. **Attract new community members** - Lower barriers for newcomers unfamiliar with MUD terminology and culture
3. **Serve administrators** - Provide clear value proposition and simple onboarding for game owners listing their MUDs
4. **Celebrate the community** - Honor 45+ years of MUD history while presenting the genre as active and relevant
5. **Improve engagement** - Increase time on site and return visits through compelling content structure
